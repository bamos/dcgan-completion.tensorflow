# Image Completion with Deep Learning in TensorFlow

![](/completion.compressed.gif)

+ [See my blog post for more details and usage instructions](http://bamos.github.io/2016/08/09/deep-completion/).
+ This repository implements Raymond Yeh and Chen Chen et al.'s paper
  [Semantic Image Inpainting with Perceptual and Contextual Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07539).
+ Most of the code in this repository was written by modifying a
  duplicate of [Taehoon Kim's](http://carpedm20.github.io/)
  [DCGAN-tensorflow](https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow) project,
  which is MIT-licensed.
  My modifications are also [MIT-licensed](./LICENSE).
+ The [./checkpoint](./checkpoint) directory contains a pre-trained
  model for faces used in the blog post.
